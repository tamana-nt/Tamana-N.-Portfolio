# Tamana-N.-Portfolio
## About Me:
Hi, I'm Tamana N., a student developer with a passion for web development. My journey into coding started when I took a web development class with Mission Bit last year, and that's where I discovered my love for building websites. Over the past year, I've sharpened my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm thrilled to share my progress through this portfolio. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in web development, and I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned to real-world projects. This portfolio is a reflection of my commitment to improving my skills and continuing my growth as a developer.

## Project Overview:
This portfolio is not just a collection of my work; it’s a snapshot of my growth as a developer. It’s a space where I can showcase the projects I’ve worked on over the past year, highlighting my skills in web design and programming. I've worked hard to learn how to build responsive, interactive websites and manage my code with GitHub, and I'm excited to keep pushing myself to do even better. This portfolio represents where I am today, and it motivates me to keep challenging myself in the future.

## Portfolio Site Includes:
- **About Me**: A brief introduction to who I am as a developer.
- **Projects**: A collection of web development projects I’ve worked on, demonstrating various technical skills.
- **Contact**: Information on how to get in touch with me for potential opportunities or collaborations.

## Featured Projects:
1. **APA Citation Generator**: This project is a tool that allows users to input details like author, title, and URL to automatically generate a citation in APA format. It was a great way for me to practice working with form elements, capturing user input, and dynamically updating the page using JavaScript.

2. **Stopwatch**:This simple stopwatch app lets users start, stop, and reset the timer. I created this project to learn about handling user interactions, manipulating the DOM, and using JavaScript’s setInterval function to keep track of time. It’s a perfect example of creating a functional, user-friendly app with just a few lines of code.

3. **Quote Generator**: In this project, I built a tool that generates random quotes at the click of a button. I used JavaScript to fetch random quotes and dynamically update the page with them. This project helped me practice working with APIs and creating a smooth, intuitive user interface.

4. **Black Jack Game**: This is a simple Blackjack game where users can try their luck against the computer. The project is a fun way to apply my JavaScript skills, working with game logic, random number generation, and DOM manipulation to create an interactive experience. It was a fun challenge and a great way to practice working with conditional logic and event handling.
